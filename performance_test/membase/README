This folder contains performance test suite for membase

What the Framework does:
Based on the inputs in the config file:
- It checks if the test machines are reachable.
- Installs the required build if specified and copies the startup files
- Starts Membase servers in Master => Slave
- Runs battery of tests to grab various metrics, graphs, stats across various data sample size

To run the test:
1. Download the membase_automation folder git clone git git@github-ca.corp.zynga.com:sbkrishnamurthy/membase_automation.git
2. cd performance_test/membase
3. Edit the config file 
	a. The framework uses password / key based authentication to connect across machines. 
	- To use password based, you need setup a test account with sudo access. Input the same in the config file.
	- To use key based auth, ensure private and public key are setup in the automation box and test machines. Input only the username and leave password blank ""
	b. Two test machines are needed to run this test. Input the same under MASTER_SERVER, SLAVE_SERVER_1.
	c. MEMBASE_VERSION - define this as the right file needed for starting membase will be copied based on this.
	d. Build information - This field can take multiple builds for the same components. Tests will be run across each build combination.
	e. MEMBASE_CLOUD – Define the cloud as this is needed for pulling the graphs after the tests are run.
4. php performance_test.php
